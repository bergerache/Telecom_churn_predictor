# 🎯 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

> **Machine learning solution to predict customer churn and enable proactive retention strategies**
---

## 🚀 Business Problem

Telecom operators face significant challenges with customer retention, as **customer acquisition costs are typically 5-25x higher** than retention costs. This project develops a machine learning solution to identify customers at risk of churning, enabling Interconnect to offer targeted promotional codes and special plans before customers leave.

### 💡 Why This Matters
- **Proactive retention strategies** through early churn identification
- **Optimize marketing spend** by targeting high-risk customers
- **Reduce revenue loss** from customer defection
- **Increase customer lifetime value** through data-driven interventions

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

Multi-source dataset from Interconnect telecom operator including **7,043 customers**:

| **Data Source** | **Key Features** |
|---|---|
| 📋 **Contract Information** | Begin/end dates, contract types, billing preferences, payment methods |
| 👤 **Personal Data** | Demographics, senior citizen status, family information |
| 🌐 **Internet Services** | DSL/Fiber connections, security features, streaming services |
| 📞 **Phone Services** | Multiple line options and usage patterns |

### 🎯 **Target Variable**
- **26.5% churn rate** (1,869 churned customers out of 7,043)
- **Business-critical imbalance** requiring specialized handling

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### 🧹 **Data Preprocessing & Engineering**
- **Multi-source integration**: Merged 4 datasets using customer ID joins
- **Date processing**: Converted contract dates to identify active vs churned customers
- **Missing value treatment**: Filled gaps with business logic (new customers = 0 total charges)
- **Feature engineering**: Created `duration_days` from contract length for enhanced variability
- **Categorical encoding**: Mapped text values to numeric (Yes/No → 1/0, contract types → 0/1/2)

### 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis**
Key business insights discovered:

| **Finding** | **Churn Impact** |
|---|---|
| 📝 **Electronic check payments** | Higher churn rates - potential payment friction |
| 📅 **Month-to-month contracts** | Significantly higher churn vs annual contracts |
| 💰 **Monthly charges** | Churned customers average ~$80 vs $65 for retained |
| 🌐 **Fiber optic service** | Highest churn ratio - service quality issues |
| ⏱️ **Contract duration** | Longer tenure strongly correlates with retention |

### 🤖 **Model Development**
Implemented comprehensive ML pipeline:

```python
# Models Tested
├── Dummy Classifier (Baseline)
├── Logistic Regression 
├── Random Forest
├── Gradient Boosting ⭐ (Best Performer)
└── AdaBoost
```

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **SMOTE oversampling** for class imbalance handling
- **MinMax scaling** for feature normalization  
- **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization
- **Cross-validation** with F1-score optimization

### 📊 **Model Evaluation Strategy**
**F1-score selected as primary metric** - balances precision and recall for business impact where both false positives (unnecessary interventions) and false negatives (missed churners) carry costs.

---

## 🎯 Key Results

### 🏆 **Best Model: Gradient Boosting**
- **F1-Score: 0.79** (2.8x better than baseline)
- **Overall Accuracy: 89%**
- **Precision: 82%** - High confidence in churn predictions
- **Recall: 76%** - Captures 3 out of 4 potential churners

### 📊 **Model Comparison**

| **Model** | **F1-Score** | **Accuracy** | **Business Value** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dummy Classifier | 0.28 | 61% | Baseline |
| Logistic Regression | 0.66 | 77% | Good interpretability |
| Random Forest | 0.67 | 79% | Feature importance insights |
| **Gradient Boosting** | **0.79** | **89%** | **Optimal performance** |
| AdaBoost | 0.74 | 86% | Strong alternative |

### 🔍 **Key Predictive Factors**
1. **Contract Type** - Month-to-month customers at highest risk
2. **Payment Method** - Electronic check users show elevated churn
3. **Service Tenure** - Newer customers more likely to leave
4. **Monthly Charges** - Price sensitivity impacts retention
5. **Internet Service Type** - Fiber optic users require attention

## 💼 Business Impact

### 🎯 **Immediate Actionable Insights**
- **Target month-to-month customers** with loyalty programs
- **Improve electronic check payment experience** 
- **Focus retention efforts on fiber optic subscribers**
- **Implement graduated pricing** for high-charge customers
- **Enhance onboarding** for new subscribers (first 90 days critical)

### 📈 **Expected ROI**
- **76% recall rate** enables proactive intervention for majority of at-risk customers
- **82% precision** minimizes wasted marketing spend on false positives
- **Early intervention** potential saves acquisition costs for retained customers
